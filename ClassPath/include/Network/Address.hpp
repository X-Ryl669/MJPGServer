/** Network specific code, like socket classes declaration and others.

    You'll use code from this namespace to build network aware applications.

    The Address namespace provides class to manipulate network addresses
    (from low level like Network::Address::IPV4, Network::Address::IPV6, to full URL
    parsing class like Network::Address::URL)


    This namespace supports many functions for socket based programming, but also for
    network interface analysis.

    For example, you can detect the private IP of all interfaces, their route, their mask.
    You can detect the interface type (Ethernet / Wifi), the speed (100M / 54M), the Wifi
    connected SSID and key (in Network::Address::IPV4 and Network::Address::IPV6)

    You can also use the UDT library (stream connection over UDP, useful for NAT passthrough)
    transparently (in Network::Socket::UDTSocket)

    One of the main interest of this library, is to abstract the used socket class, and deal
    with socket that would be best suited for the destination.
    This can be done easily with the Network::Socket::Local class.

    You might not want to deal with socket at all, and instead only with connections.
    In that case, see Network::Connection::Datagram and Network::Connection::Stream

    If you intend to monitor multiple sockets (servers, P2P), you will be interested in
    Network::Socket::MonitoringPool (abstraction over select, or epoll when available).

    If you plan to write a server, don't miss Network::Server namespace, you'll get a full
    performance server (best known method to date) for your application by writing a very
    small callback class.
